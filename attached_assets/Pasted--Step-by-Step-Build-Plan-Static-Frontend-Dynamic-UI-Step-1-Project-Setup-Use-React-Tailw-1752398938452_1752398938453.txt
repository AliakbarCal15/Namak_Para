🛠️ Step-by-Step Build Plan (Static Frontend + Dynamic UI)
✅ Step 1: Project Setup
Use React + Tailwind CSS (preferred)

OR use plain HTML + JS + Tailwind if React not needed

Set up file structure:

cpp
Copy
Edit
public/
src/
  └─ App.jsx
  └─ components/
        └─ Dashboard.jsx
        └─ Orders.jsx
        └─ MaterialTracker.jsx
        └─ ProfitCalculator.jsx
        └─ PaymentTracker.jsx
        └─ Forecast.jsx
✅ Step 2: Build Layout (App.jsx)
Create a sidebar or tabs for navigation

Default page shows Dashboard

Use Tailwind for responsiveness

Store selected tab in state, and load component conditionally

✅ Step 3: Orders Module (Orders.jsx)
Form to add new order: customer, date, quantity (50g, 100g, etc.)

Auto weight + price calculation

Store orders in localStorage

Table showing all orders (with filter by date/customer)

✅ Step 4: Material Tracker (MaterialTracker.jsx)
Add materials: Maida, Oil, Gas, Salt, Ajwain

Set price per unit (e.g. ₹50/kg Maida)

Enter usage (e.g. 3kg maida today)

Auto-yield logic (e.g. 3kg maida = 4.2kg output)

Save entries with date in localStorage

✅ Step 5: Profit Calculator (ProfitCalculator.jsx)
Link orders + material cost

Show:

Total Sale

Total Raw Material Cost

Gas/Flame Cost (₹/min)

Net Profit

Show profit per packet (e.g. 50g = ₹7 profit)

✅ Step 6: Payment Tracker (PaymentTracker.jsx)
Fetch orders with amount to collect

For each customer:

Add payment entry

Auto update status: Paid / Partial / Unpaid

Add payment mode + date

Table view + summary:

Total Received

Total Due

Customer-wise breakdown

✅ Step 7: Forecast Module (Forecast.jsx)
Based on upcoming orders, show:

Estimated required maida, oil, gas etc.

Stock planning (future week/day prep)

Use average yield logic (e.g. 1kg maida = 1.3kg output)

✅ Step 8: Dashboard (Dashboard.jsx)
Real-time summary from all modules:

📊 Orders today

💰 Total sales

🧾 Total received

❌ Pending payments

📦 Material used today

🔥 Net Profit

🔧 Tech Used
